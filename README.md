# CSV File Search Software
During this project I wanted to better understand the relationship between java and data manipulation and visualization.

## Tools and Software:
In this software I wanted to better understand how to read and manipulate a CSV file using various tools in Java. This software is meant to read a CSV file, create a list of dictionaries that connects to individual pieces of information. The software will then prompt a user to search by certain criteria that will then display all rows that fit this information.

## Development Environment:
During this project I used Java as my primary language and devloped the code in Visual Studio Code. I used the java io and java util libraries that encapsulate numerous libraries within them. I used Hashtables and Lists as my primary type of objects.

### Useful Websites for learning the basics of Java are listed below:
- https://www.w3schools.com/java/
- https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/ 

### Future Work:
In the future there are multiple feature I would like to implement:
1. Using a logarithmic search algorithm for names to improve efficiency.
2.  Clean up displayed information to improve readability.
3.  Allow for adjusting multiple features at a time.
4.  Format data for better legibility.
